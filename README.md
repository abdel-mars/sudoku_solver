🚀 Project Overview
This project implements a Sudoku solver using Go and the backtracking algorithm. It follows the basic rules of Sudoku:

Each number (1-9) must appear only once in each row.
Each number (1-9) must appear only once in each column.
Each number (1-9) must appear only once in each 3x3 subgrid.
The solver checks for valid input and attempts to solve the puzzle efficiently.
